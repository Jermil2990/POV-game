# Web Development Project 2 - *POV-Tiktok*

Submitted by: **Jerrick Miles**

This web app: **This is a game about the connection between physical objects and fleeting digital memories. Players explore a quiet 3D grocery store where everyday items—a faded jacket, a hydro flask, a pair of headphones—act as portals to different online eras. Clicking an item transports you into a small, AI-generated room reflecting a specific trend, like 90s grunge or VSCO-core. The goal is to find the hidden flashcard, designed to look like a simple polaroid or a handwritten note, and identify the TikTok trend it represents. It's a quiet, authentic game concept that examines how digital culture leaves a tangible echo in the real world**

Time spent: **67** hours spent in total
